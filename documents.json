"},{"score":5.3320455551,"text":"Smoking elevates your heart rate and increases your metabolism; when you quit, you burn about 100 fewer calories a day. After quitting, it can take weeks or even months for your metabolism to rebound.Smoking suppresses hunger.  Nicotine causes the liver to release glycogen, which raises your blood-sugar level slightly and suppresses appetite.  Until your metabolism adjusts, expect to gain about a pound a week.Smoking makes you feel good.  Nicotine increases the levels of dopamine (a chemical associated with pleasure) in the brain.  High-calorie treats, such as candy and cookies, produce much the same effect, so after quitting, you may be tempted to replace cigarettes with food.  Alcohol boosts dopamine levels as well, and studies show that alcohol use tends to increase after quitting.  This mechanism may explain why bupropion (Zyban), an antidepressant that works on the brains dopamine system, has shown to be helpful for smoking cessation.Smoking gives you something to do with your mouth and hands.  Eating does the same\u0097and makes you feel less deprived by your decision to quit.Smoking dulls your taste buds.  After you quit, food begins to taste and smell better, so you may find yourself wanting to eat more.Smoking is reliable when other things are not. "}]}
