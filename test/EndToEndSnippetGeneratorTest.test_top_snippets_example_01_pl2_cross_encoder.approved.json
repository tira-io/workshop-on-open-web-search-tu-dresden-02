This allows players to strategically use Overdrive to raise the Band Meter and pass portions of a song they otherwise might have failed.

The unnamed game will be ready by the 2009 holiday season, and promises to take players on a journey through the Beatles music, sampling songs from all stages of the band's career.\nDetails on the actual game experience was scarce, but Harmonix CEO Alex Rigopoulus says the game will be a standalone product -- not an expansion pack -- but also that it would not be a 'Rock Band' game.

How did they do it?  They invented history's greatest hairdo (for men and women).  They wrote four-chord pop and symphonic mood music without claiming one's superiority over the other.  They were political, sexual, comical and emotional.  They were smart, classy and stoned. ",

Of course we also would have been cheated out of The Beatles' greatest indulgence, which is anything but tedious.\nEssentially a collection of solo tracks, \"The White Album\" showcases the Fabs at their most absurd (\"Wild Honey Pie,\" \"Piggies\") and their most incendiary (\"Revolution 9,\" \"Why Don't We Do it in the Road?\").  You get Lennon's most rousing rocker in \"Everybody's Got Something to Hide Except For Me and My Monkey,\" and the most tender, emotionally honest moment of his career in the maternal ode \"Julia.\"\nSeemingly bound by no limits of good taste or good sense, Paul tinkers with 12-bar blues on \"Birthday,\" music hall on \"Honey Pie\" and folk/country on \"Rocky Raccoon.\" ",

Overdrive for drummers can be deployed by hitting the crash cymbal (green note for right-handed configuration) that appears directly after a freestyle drum fill.  The second version of the controller, distributed with Rock Band 2, introduced quieter, \"velocity sensitive\" drum pads, a reinforced bass pedal, wireless capabilities, and compatibility with separately-sold cymbals.  ION Audio has also produced a premium drum kit that includes cymbals and can be upgraded with a drum brain to be used as an electronic drum kit.\n  The microphone is a standard USB microphone.  Players can use most other USB microphones, while Xbox 360 users can substitute their console's headset, if they wish.

Overdrive for drummers can be deployed by hitting the crash cymbal (green note for right-handed configuration) that appears directly after a freestyle drum fill.  The second version of the controller, distributed with Rock Band 2, introduced quieter, \"velocity sensitive\" drum pads, a reinforced bass pedal, wireless capabilities, and compatibility with separately-sold cymbals.  ION Audio has also produced a premium drum kit that includes cymbals and can be upgraded with a drum brain to be used as an electronic drum kit.\n  The microphone is a standard USB microphone.  Players can use most other USB microphones, while Xbox 360 users can substitute their console's headset, if they wish.

Though John was only 16, he had already formed a band called the Quarry Men, who were performing at the fete.  Mutual friends introduced them after the show and Paul, who had just turned 15, wowed John with his guitar playing and ability to remember lyrics. ",

However, since John, Paul, and George all played guitars, they were still looking for someone to play bass guitar and/or the drums.\n  In 1959, Stu Sutcliffe, an art student who couldn't play a lick, filled the position of bass guitarist and in 1960, Pete Best, who was popular with the girls, became the drummer.  In the summer of 1960, the band was offered a two-month gig in Hamburg, Germany.It was also in 1960 that the Stu suggested a new name for the band.  In honor of Buddy Holly's band, the Crickets, -- of whom Stu was a huge fan -- he recommended the name of \"The Beetles.\"  John changed the spelling of the name to \"Beatles\" as a pun for \"beat music,\" another name for rock 'n' roll.In 1961, back in Hamburg, Stu quit the band and went back to studying art, so Paul took up the bass guitar.

Epstein succeeded in getting the band a record contract in March 1962.  After hearing a few sample songs, George Martin, the producer, decided he liked the music but was even more enchanted with the boys' witty humor.  Martin signed the band to a one-year record contract but recommended a studio drummer for all recordings.  John, Paul, and George used this as an excuse to fire Best and replace him with Ringo Starr.In September 1962, the Beatles recorded their first single.  On one side of the record was the song \"Love Me Do\" and on the flip side, \"P.S. I Love You.\"  Their first single was a success but it was their second, with the song \"Please Please Me,\" that made them their first number-one hit.  By early 1963, their fame began to soar.  After quickly recording a long album, the Beatles spent much of 1963 touring.Though Beatlemania had overtaken Great Britain, the Beatles still had the challenge of the United States. ",

Perhaps their most popular work.  By that time John had married Yoko Ono, a photographer, and the band was falling apart.  The band would release 2 more albums.  et It Be and bbey Road et It Beinvolved making a film in which they were filmed rehearsing, recording, and finally performing new songs.  Problems during the recording led it to be left aside.  Then they released bbey Roadin 1969 and In April 1970 Paul announced that he was leaving the group.  The others followed.\nWith the Beatles no longer together Producer Phil Spector sorted through hundreds of hours of tapes, and put together what would be the last Beatles album Let It Be in 1970.  Ironically it was a song from this album that gave the Beatles their first Grammy.  The long and winding road won the Grammy for the best song for a motion picture.  Rumors of a reunion were popular until 1980 when John Lennon was murdered.\n  The Beatles obviously affected many lives from the shrieking girls and cheering boys, to the parents of those kids, to the police officers that tried their best to contain the uncontrollable mobs of fans.

With 17 No.1 hits, their musical development was as rapid as it was innovative - from the pure Merseybeat pop of I Wanna Hold Your Hand to psychedelic mantras of Strawberry Fields Forever and Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds.  (Beatles MP3)\nThe Beatles evolved from the Quarrymen, the band John Lennon (born 9 October, 1940) formed at Quarry Bank school in 1956.  (Beatles MP3) Lennon was obsessed with the rock and roll bands of the era - Buddy Holly, Gene Vincent and Elvis Presley.  Paul McCartney, (born 18 June, 1942.  Beatles MP3) who had impressed Lennon with his musical knowledge and already burgeoning songwriting skills joined the band in 1957 and the pair immediately started writing together.  (Beatles MP3)  Within a year, two more musicians had been brought in, the 15-year-old guitarist George Harrison, Beatles MP3 (b. 25 February 1943, Liverpool, England, d. 29 November 2001, Los Angeles, California, USA) and an art school friend of Lennon's, Stuart Sutcliffe (b. 23 June 1940, Edinburgh, Scotland, d. 10 April 1962, Hamburg, Germany).

McCartney took over on bass, Harrison settled in as lead guitarist, and Lennon had rhythm guitar; everyone sang.  In mid-1961, the Beatles (minus Sutcliffe) made their first recordings in Germany, as a backup group to a British rock guitarist/singer based in Hamburg, Tony Sheridan.  The Beatles hadn't fully developed at this point, and these recordings - many of which (including a couple of Sheridan-less tracks) were issued only after the band's rise to fame - found their talents in a most embryonic state.  The Hamburg stint was also notable for gaining The Beatles sophisticated, artistic fans such as Sutcliffe's girlfriend, Astrid Kirchherr, who influenced all of them (except Best) to restyle their quiffs in the moptops that gave the musicians their most distinctive visual trademark.  (Sutcliffe, tragically, would die of a brain hemorrhage in April 1962).\nNear the end of 1961, The Beatles' exploding local popularity caught the attention of local record store manager Brian Epstein, who was soon managing the band as well.

Moreover, they were among the few artists of any discipline that were simultaneously the best at what they did and the most popular at what they did.\nRelentlessly imaginative and experimental, the Beatles grabbed a hold of the international mass consciousness in 1964 and never let go for the next six years, always staying ahead of the pack in terms of creativity but never losing their ability to communicate their increasingly sophisticated ideas to a mass audience.  Their supremacy as rock icons remains unchallenged to this day, decades after their breakup in 1970.\nEven when couching praise in specific terms, it's hard to convey the scope of The Beatles' achievements in a mere paragraph or two.  They synthesized all that was good about early rock & roll, and changed it into something original and even more exciting.  They established the prototype for the self-contained rock group that wrote and performed its own material.  As composers, their craft and melodic inventiveness were second-to-none, and key to the evolution of rock from its blues/R&B-based forms into a style that was far more eclectic, but equally visceral.

                "text": "As singers, both John Lennon and Paul McCartney were among the best and most expressive vocalists in rock; the group's harmonies were intricate and exhilarating. As performers, they were (at least until touring had ground them down) exciting and photogenic; when they retreated into the studio, they were instrumental in pioneering advanced techniques and multi-layered arrangements.  They were also the first British rock group to achieve worldwide prominence, launching a British Invasion that made rock truly an international phenomenon.\nMore than any other top group, The Beatles' success was very much a case of the whole being greater than the sum of its parts.  Their phenomenal cohesion was due in large degree to most of the group having known each other and played together in Liverpool for about five years before they began to have hit records.  Guitarist and teenage rebel John Lennon got hooked on rock & roll in the mid-'50s, and formed a band, the Quarrymen, at his secondary school.  Around mid-1957, the Quarrymen were joined by another guitarist, Paul McCartney, nearly two years Lennon's junior.  A bit later they were joined by another guitarist, George Harrison, a friend of McCartney's. ",

Before they went to Hamburg, they were considered the worst band in Liverpool, and they were.  There were 300 bands - the Beatles stunk.  They had no show. ",

Catch them \"LIVE\" before they become older than the originals!\nBiography:\nThe story starts in 1995, when a show was put together to perform in a special production of \"All You Need Is Love\" at the Ecos Amphitheatre, Frome, Somerset.  Such was the success of the show that there emerged a band, an eight piece with a backing group of five musicians and three vocalists as the front men of the band.  This ensemble enjoyed successful gigs round local pubs and clubs performing material from the Pepper album and songs from the psychedelic era.  Audiences were fascinated by this rather unusual Beatles tribute line-up with three vocalists - but the music was good and so was the humour!\n  After a couple of years of playing gigs the eight piece was reduced.  A five piece then emerged with all members being fully involved with the action.  They soon became an in-demand band with a set of Beatles covers that ran from the early rock 'n' roll numbers through to the later more complex songs of the late 60's. ",

The band was made up entirely of classmates at Quarry Bank Grammar School in Liverpool, and almost immediately after they started, they changed their name to The Quarry Men.  They played skiffle music, a mixture of folk, jazz, and blues which was popular in England at the time.\n  In the summer of 1957, The Quarry Men were setting up for a performance in a church hall when another member of the band introduced Lennon to Paul McCartney, then a 15-year-old self-taught left-handed guitar player.  He auditioned for the band when they finished their set, and was immediately invited to join, which he did in October, 1957.\nBy February 1958 Lennon was moving increasingly away from skiffle and toward rock 'n' roll.
