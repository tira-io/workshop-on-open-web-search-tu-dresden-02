Or had a night on the town where everything you could want was under one spectacular roof?  Well, it just so happens that excitement lives and breaths right here in Northeastern Pennsylvania at Mohegan Sun at Pocono Downs.\nBeing Pennsylvania\u2019s first casino was great, but being Pennsylvania\u2019s best casino was their goal.  And they\u2019ve succeeded in style, having recently completed Phase ll of Project Sunrise, a $208 million renovation that dramatically transformed them into the area\u2019s leading entertainment complex.  They\u2019re also committed to celebrating the beauty and natural resources of Northeastern Pennsylvania.  Inspiration for the architecture came from the rolling majesty of the Pocono Mountains and the richness of the Susquehanna River Valley.  \u201cOur focus and intent was to create a memorable design and experience which celebrates Northeastern Pennsylvania,\u201d said Robert Soper, President and CEO of Mohegan Sun at Pocono Downs.\nWith 55,000 square feet of new gaming space holding 2,500 slot and electronic virtual table games, many of them new to Pennsylvania, they offer countless opportunities for gaming fun and success.

They occur in service clubs, community organizations or the media.  More often than not, though, they center on how to use the power of government to improve conditions or to solve problems, with a firm conviction that government can solve all problems and that it can do no harm.\nLibertarians take issue with the involuntary means government uses to attain its ends.  Mandates and prohibitions invariably limit the allowable range of experimentation.  Freedom allows spontaneous order, which is seen in systems as diverse as artificial neural networks, agoric computers, biological evolution, ecosystems, and free-market economies. ",

They were the Delaware, Iroquois, Shawnee, Minisink, Lenape, and Paupack.  The Dutch arrived in 1659, but were forced out by the English in 1664.  More English and the Germans came in and around 1742.  Modern history begins with the first boarding house hotel, built in 1829 by Anthony Dutot.  It became the center of the resort industry in the mid-1800s.  At the turn of the century, vacationers from Philadelphia and New York City began to flock to the Poconos.  Advertised as \"Pennsylvania's Playground\", the communities began a century's long serious development.  Lake Wallenpaupack was created by damming the creek and building a hydro-electric plant. ",

                "text": "It became the third largest man-made lake in Pennsylvania, sizing at 5,200 acres and 52 miles of quiet, pristine shoreline. In the Poconos, a few eras have passed.  During prohibition, the resorts were Puritan in spirit, calling themselves, \"Friendly Mountain Resorts\"; card-playing and gambling were prohibited and golf, tennis, and other sports were not allowed on Sundays.  Before and after World War II, GIs took their wives and families.  The Poconos was then dubbed the \"Honeymoon Capital of the World\".  The heart-shaped tub was popularized here in 1963.  To this day, resorts set the mood right for honeymooners and vacationing couples.  By the 1950s, skiing took hold.  The first snow maker (used by blowing water through a nozzle) was patented in the Poconos and then perfected by 1956.  Interstates were constructed, which made the region more accessible.  Eventually, a speedway was put in, bringing in at least 100,000 NASCAR fans from all over the country twice a year.  As the Poconos has entered the 21st century, more resorts, restaurants, ski areas, and golf courses have arisen; property value has also arisen.  Population of the entire region is upwards of 300,000 residents.\n\u00a0\n ",

Or had a night on the town where everything you could want was under one spectacular roof?  Well, it just so happens that excitement lives and breaths right here in Northeastern Pennsylvania at Mohegan Sun at Pocono Downs.\nBeing Pennsylvania\u2019s first casino was great, but being Pennsylvania\u2019s best casino was their goal.  And they\u2019ve succeeded in style, having recently completed Phase ll of Project Sunrise, a $208 million renovation that dramatically transformed them into the area\u2019s leading entertainment complex.  They\u2019re also committed to celebrating the beauty and natural resources of Northeastern Pennsylvania.  Inspiration for the architecture came from the rolling majesty of the Pocono Mountains and the richness of the Susquehanna River Valley.  \u201cOur focus and intent was to create a memorable design and experience which celebrates Northeastern Pennsylvania,\u201d said Robert Soper, President and CEO of Mohegan Sun at Pocono Downs.\nWith 55,000 square feet of new gaming space holding 2,500 slot and electronic virtual table games, many of them new to Pennsylvania, they offer countless opportunities for gaming fun and success.

They occur in service clubs, community organizations or the media.  More often than not, though, they center on how to use the power of government to improve conditions or to solve problems, with a firm conviction that government can solve all problems and that it can do no harm.\nLibertarians take issue with the involuntary means government uses to attain its ends.  Mandates and prohibitions invariably limit the allowable range of experimentation.  Freedom allows spontaneous order, which is seen in systems as diverse as artificial neural networks, agoric computers, biological evolution, ecosystems, and free-market economies. ",

Or had a night on the town where everything you could want was under one spectacular roof?  Well, it just so happens that excitement lives and breaths right here in Northeastern Pennsylvania at Mohegan Sun at Pocono Downs.\nBeing Pennsylvania\u2019s first casino was great, but being Pennsylvania\u2019s best casino was their goal.

They\u2019re also committed to celebrating the beauty and natural resources of Northeastern Pennsylvania.  Inspiration for the architecture came from the rolling majesty of the Pocono Mountains and the richness of the Susquehanna River Valley.  \u201cOur focus and intent was to create a memorable design and experience which celebrates Northeastern Pennsylvania,\u201d said Robert Soper, President and CEO of Mohegan Sun at Pocono Downs.\nWith 55,000 square feet of new gaming space holding 2,500 slot and electronic virtual table games, many of them new to Pennsylvania, they offer countless opportunities for gaming fun and success.

Or had a night on the town where everything you could want was under one spectacular roof?  Well, it just so happens that excitement lives and breaths right here in Northeastern Pennsylvania at Mohegan Sun at Pocono Downs.\nBeing Pennsylvania\u2019s first casino was great, but being Pennsylvania\u2019s best casino was their goal.  And they\u2019ve succeeded in style, having recently completed Phase ll of Project Sunrise, a $208 million renovation that dramatically transformed them into the area\u2019s leading entertainment complex.  They\u2019re also committed to celebrating the beauty and natural resources of Northeastern Pennsylvania.  Inspiration for the architecture came from the rolling majesty of the Pocono Mountains and the richness of the Susquehanna River Valley.  \u201cOur focus and intent was to create a memorable design and experience which celebrates Northeastern Pennsylvania,\u201d said Robert Soper, President and CEO of Mohegan Sun at Pocono Downs.\nWith 55,000 square feet of new gaming space holding 2,500 slot and electronic virtual table games, many of them new to Pennsylvania, they offer countless opportunities for gaming fun and success.

We like the activity directors at Pradise Stream.  Each resort it slightly different but each has positive things to offer.  You can go the the Caesars resorts and not have to worry about tipping, dinner or breakfast bills, or cover charges.  The resort is all inclusive.  The only thing you may need to buy is lunch.  We were sorry to see that the Brookdale on the Lake resort was sold.  Even though we will still go every year.\nSome guests have complained about the service being a little slow in the dining room.  It can be, but we did not care because we wanted to take our time and relax.  The staff has alot of people to serve in a short period of time.\nI have special dietary need and all I had to do it call the kitchen with my special needs and they took care of me.\nSome of the activities are x-rated and some people may not like that.  We have taken our parents with us and they would just skip those activities.\nAll in all, we love Caesars and will continue to return.\n ",

Tillinghast, as well as the modern master \u0096 Jack Nicklaus \u0096 the Pocono Mountains golf properties are plentiful and as varied as any destination in the country.\nWhether searching for a challenging course that will test the lowest handicapper or a beginner-friendly track with equally budget-friendly prices, the Pocono Mountains offer something to match any level of play. A similar dichotomy exists in design \u0096 from tight, tree-lined fairways and postage-stamp greens to wide open layouts with expansive putting complexes and long views of Mother Nature\u0092s beauty.\nA destination flush with courses that boast such a colorful and impressive history might be tempted to rest on its collective laurels, but not the Pocono Mountains.  One such property \u0096 The Shawnee Inn and Golf Resort \u0096 host to the 1938 PGA Championship on its original Tillinghast design.  The 27-hole Shawnee Resort recently added a nine-hole lighted course for evening play and continues making aesthetic improvements.\nGolfer-friendly enhancements are prevalent throughout the Pocono Mountains, as well.
