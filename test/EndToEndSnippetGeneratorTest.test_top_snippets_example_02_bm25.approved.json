They occur in service clubs, community organizations or the media.  More often than not, though, they center on how to use the power of government to improve conditions or to solve problems, with a firm conviction that government can solve all problems and that it can do no harm.\nLibertarians take issue with the involuntary means government uses to attain its ends.  Mandates and prohibitions invariably limit the allowable range of experimentation.  Freedom allows spontaneous order, which is seen in systems as diverse as artificial neural networks, agoric computers, biological evolution, ecosystems, and free-market economies. ",

Pocono Raceway has a massive front straight that often sees cars going\nfour, five and six wide.  Add the high speeds to the challenging turns and you've got a 2.5 mile superspeedway that drives\nlike a road course.The Track: Pocono Speedway is a 2.5 mile three-cornered speedway.  The triangle-shaped track has three different corner lengths and\nbankings making it very difficult to set up a car and to drive well.  Pocono is, in a word, unique.As difficult as it is to\nset up and drive Pocono frequently hosts some great racing with races often decided within the last couple of laps.Race Distance: 200 laps = 500 milesThe Big Picture: This is race number 14 of 36.  We are halfway to the cutoff.  It is time to make your move if you want to race\nfor The Chase.\nThe current points top ten are: 1. ",

They occur in service clubs, community organizations or the media.  More often than not, though, they center on how to use the power of government to improve conditions or to solve problems, with a firm conviction that government can solve all problems and that it can do no harm.\nLibertarians take issue with the involuntary means government uses to attain its ends.  Mandates and prohibitions invariably limit the allowable range of experimentation.  Freedom allows spontaneous order, which is seen in systems as diverse as artificial neural networks, agoric computers, biological evolution, ecosystems, and free-market economies. ",

We like the activity directors at Pradise Stream.  Each resort it slightly different but each has positive things to offer.  You can go the the Caesars resorts and not have to worry about tipping, dinner or breakfast bills, or cover charges.  The resort is all inclusive.  The only thing you may need to buy is lunch.  We were sorry to see that the Brookdale on the Lake resort was sold.  Even though we will still go every year.\nSome guests have complained about the service being a little slow in the dining room.  It can be, but we did not care because we wanted to take our time and relax.  The staff has alot of people to serve in a short period of time.\nI have special dietary need and all I had to do it call the kitchen with my special needs and they took care of me.\nSome of the activities are x-rated and some people may not like that.

That was possibly the\nsorriest race I have ever seen in my life!  13 green flag laps were the most run\nat one time last Sunday.  Absolutely ridiculous tire problems the entire race.  I\ndo feel it effected our head to head matchups.  Still crushing the man this year\nagain in Nascar!\nFor starters, I think Denny Hamlin has the best shot of winning this race.\nHamlin has 2 wins, 4 Top 5 finishes and 5 Top 10 finishes in his 5 starts here\nin Pocono.  Hamlin an average finish of 2.8 here in Pocono which is the best\naverage finish among all drivers.  Past 2 years, Denny Hamlin's average finish at\ntrack type - FLAT SUPERSPEEDWAY is 7.4.  In 5 races, he has 0 wins and 4 top 10\nfinishes.\nNext in line I would go with Jeff Gordon.  Gordon has four wins, 15 Top 5\nfinishes and 21 Top 10 finishes in 31 starts here in Pocono.  Gordon has an\naverage finish of 10.3 here in Pocono.  Past two seasons, Jeff Gordon's average\nfinish at track type - FLAT SUPERSPEEDWAY is 5.4.  In 5 races, he has 1 win and 4\ntop 10 finishes. ",
