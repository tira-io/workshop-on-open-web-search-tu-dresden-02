The profession began in the late 1960s when attorneys were seeking ways to become more efficient.  Since then, the scope of work paralegals perform has grown, as has demand.  Duties will vary, depending on the type and size of employer, as well as your experience.\n9 to 5:\nBy far, most paralegals work for private law firms.  But some also work in large companies\u2019 legal departments, large banks\u2019 trust and estate departments or for hospitals, real estate and title insurance companies.  In government, paralegals might work for public defenders, prosecutors, city attorneys or a number of other government agencies or judicial services.  You might get out of the office from time to time, traveling to law libraries, attorney offices, courts and various agencies.\nRecession-Proof\nThe paralegal profession is growing rapidly and is more recession-proof than many others.

In good economic times, paralegals can find more work in corporate, real estate and intellectual property law.  But in difficult economic times, areas such as bankruptcy law may be booming.\n  The field is expected to grow at least 20 percent between now and 2016.  People and companies will continue to need legal services and paralegals help save money in many law firms by easing the burden of the attorney, freeing him or her to spend more time on clients and litigation.\nPay and Benefits\nThe pay for paralegals varies depending on geographic region, employer and level of education or experience.  The U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s latest data put median full-time salaries at about $43,000 a year.  You probably can earn more if you work in the federal government or move into company management.  Naiser says that Texas salaries for entry-level paralegals average about $35,000 - $40,000 per year.\nMost paralegals receive benefits such as sick and vacation leave.  Many also receive pension plans and health insurance coverage, depending on the size and type of employer. ",

Unlike other texts that might focus on skill development over concept and theory, this book puts forth that understanding the ideas behind group dynamics and counseling is vital in applying them in real-life situations.\nAn integrative theoretical approach to group leadership throughout the text lends students a greater expertise and deeper understanding for leading both clinical and non-clinical groups.

Program guidelines are simple and requirements minimal.  Mentors and proteges are matched based on common professional interests and other factors, such as practice preference and geographic region.  Pairs should have at least three contacts during the academic year.  Mentors and proteges may agree to have more contacts.  The first contact may be our exciting October \"Kick-Off\" event.  We hope that mentoring relationships will continue beyond the student's first year.  As a mentor, you can share informal advice on a wide range of topics including law school, legal practice areas, ethical issues, and the role of lawyers and judges in the profession.  The Program provides you with an excellent opportunity to help shape the future of the profession, strengthen the \"Widener Network,\" and make a positive difference in the development of a future colleague.  Many mentors report benefits to themselves as well.  Mentors may find their own appreciation for the legal profession renewed through exposure to the excitement and idealism of a first-year law student.  The only requirements for a mentor are membership in any state's bar and two years of experience.  Participation is voluntary. ",

Job freedom.  Massage therapists are their own bosses.  They control the number of hours a day they want to work, how many days they wish to work a week\u2013and where they want to work.  You can work at home, for instance, or rent (or share) office space with other health practitioners.  Planning a vacation?  You can book your calendar accordingly, work hard for a number of weeks, and take off for as long as you want to sun yourself in the sand.\n2.  Huge variety of workplaces.  Massage therapists can hook up with other medical practioners or associate their practice with a growing wealth of business alliances.  For instance, massage therapists can work at health clubs, spas, chiropractor offices, cruise ships, salons, yoga centers, with professional or amateur sports teams, massage therapy clinics, shopping malls, or in corporate offices where companies offer chair massage to their employees.\n3.  You help people.  Many massage therapists love the opportunity to affect lives. ",

The form of program a student takes usually depends on several factors, including:\nPrior Educational Experience - Students who already possess a college degree are not likely to attend a two or four year paralegal program.\nPrior Life Experience - Many paralegal certificate students have valuable real-world experience, but lack qualifications to be competitive for job opportunities.\nMotivation - Students who take certificate programs must be motivated, since they are expected to gain knowledge and skills in a relatively short period of time.\nCompensation - Graduates of certificate programs are best compensated.\nWhy are certificate program graduates paid more?\nAttorneys are interested in paralegals who can perform specific law related tasks efficiently and accurately.  They want, and are willing to pay for, paralegals who possess skills that make them and their firm more productive.  As a general rule, attorneys don't care about the geometry, psychology, and other general study courses an employee has taken.  They care about whether the employee can maintain a client file, whether an employee can conduct legal research, whether an employee can draft legal documents, and perform other relevant tasks. ",

From hospital-based nursing to home nursing, community nursing and beyond, the career options available to formally trained RNs are vast.\nThere are three main paths to becoming a registered nurse.  The most recommended is the bachelor of science in nursing (BSN), a 4-5 year program covering a wide array of theoretical and technical nursing skills.  BSN programs are a minimum requirement for many RN positions.  Another option is the associate degree in nursing (ADN), which is usually a two-year program covering the technical aspects of nursing.  Less common, but still in use is the diploma, a 3-year program covering basic nursing skills. ",

Registered nurses holding associate degrees and diplomas sometimes pursue further education in the form of an RN-to-BSN program.  In fact, nurses often finish an ADN program to gain entry-level employment, then use their employer's tuition reimbursement benefits to finish their BSN degrees.  Of course, the level of education you choose to pursue will depend on the type of nursing you wish to go into.\nPrerequisite course work\nA typical BSN nursing curriculum consists of two parts: the biological, physical, and social sciences that contributes to the science of nursing, and the liberal arts component that develops the intelligence, social, and cultural aspects of nursing.

However, each student must first complete an entrance exam -- this could be the Nursing Entrance Test (NET), a three-hour test that covers basic math, English and reading skills, or the Test of Essential Academic Skills (TEAS), which gauges the student's abilities in math, English, reading and science.  Information on the NET test can be found at StudyGuideZone.com, and the TEAS test is explained at TestPrepReview.com.

At the July meeting the name he PARAVIEWwas adopted.  By June,\n1987, the PARAVIEW was expanded to a magazine- style format published quarterly\nwith substantive articles, pictures and regular and special feature articles.\nUntil 1999, between quarterly issues of the PARAVIEW, a six page supplemental\nnewsletter, the PARAVIEW EXTRA kept members advised of the Association meeting\ndates and activities.\nMPA established a scholarship to assist students in the\nMetrolina area paralegal technology programs.  The scholarship, known as the\nMeredith R. Pollette Memorial Scholarship (named in memory of a founding member\nand a staunch supporter of MPA), is an essay contest with entries judged by\nselected members of MPA.  Over the years, the amount of the scholarship has\nincreased to its current amount of $300. ",
