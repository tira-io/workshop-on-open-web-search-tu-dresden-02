        "text": "Perhaps someone can rummagethat out of their \"old email.\"\nCheers, Mike Mills\nDear James (and the reference group):I have followed your initial query and the responses to it. Your concerns were very much at the forefront of the committee's concerns, and in particular the concerns of the faculty representatives.  On a personal note, I was very much concerned over the potential loss of TIAA-CREF for my own personal retirement investments and for potential impact on faculty recruitment.\nAs Mike Mills has outlined in his response, based on the evidence presented concerning the 403b administration changes and the strength of the packages offered by the finalists in the process, Diversified was clearly stronger.  They offered a stronger portfolio, stronger servicing, and bring a speciality in retirement investing in both the for profit and non-profit sectors.  They have a strong and growing portfolio of higher education accounts.  As a subsidiary of Transamerica, the company is a substantial player.\nAs best I know, the demand that you refer to that some institutions must have more than one 403b provider is not something that is legislated, but rather negotiated in the course of labor relations.

        "text": "Should any faculty be interested in investing in a TIAA mutual fund, many of the TIAAmutual funds will be available to faculty via Diversified.\nOf course, one can get almost any ranking, depending on what criteria were chosen to rank. How robust is the ranking to the use of these or other criteria?\n-- The consulting firm provided an extremely detailed set of criteria and data, and arrived at overall rankings onseveral criteria.  This data is available, I presume, to any faculty member to review.\nI don't mean to be suspicious, but is there independent evidence that we really have to go to one plan, e.g., is this what all universities are doing?\n-- It is my understanding, based on the legal information provided by the consultant's attorney (who attended all of the meetingsand company presentations) that the new 403b regulations that go into effect Jan 1st have far more stringent recording keepingand auditing requirements, and that coordinating that information between two different 403b administrators would be bothdifficult and expensive.  Should they make mistakes in the coordination, it is my understanding that LMUcould be held liable.\nCheers, Mike Mills\nI agree that presenting the options to the stakeholders is a good idea. "
