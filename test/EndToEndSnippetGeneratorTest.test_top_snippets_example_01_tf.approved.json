Liverpudlian roustabouts in love with American rock 'n' roll pick up guitars, move to Hamburg to learn to play, figure out how to write pop songs and save the world for teenagers.  How did they do it?  They invented history's greatest hairdo (for men and women).  They wrote four-chord pop and symphonic mood music without claiming one's superiority over the other.  They were political, sexual, comical and emotional.  They were smart, classy and stoned. ",

Had he succeeded, we may have been spared many of the indulgent, tedious double albums released in its 30-year wake.  Of course we also would have been cheated out of The Beatles' greatest indulgence, which is anything but tedious.\nEssentially a collection of solo tracks, \"The White Album\" showcases the Fabs at their most absurd (\"Wild Honey Pie,\" \"Piggies\") and their most incendiary (\"Revolution 9,\" \"Why Don't We Do it in the Road?\").  You get Lennon's most rousing rocker in \"Everybody's Got Something to Hide Except For Me and My Monkey,\" and the most tender, emotionally honest moment of his career in the maternal ode \"Julia.\"\nSeemingly bound by no limits of good taste or good sense, Paul tinkers with 12-bar blues on \"Birthday,\" music hall on \"Honey Pie\" and folk/country on \"Rocky Raccoon.\" ",

However, since John, Paul, and George all played guitars, they were still looking for someone to play bass guitar and/or the drums.\n  In 1959, Stu Sutcliffe, an art student who couldn't play a lick, filled the position of bass guitarist and in 1960, Pete Best, who was popular with the girls, became the drummer.  In the summer of 1960, the band was offered a two-month gig in Hamburg, Germany.It was also in 1960 that the Stu suggested a new name for the band.  In honor of Buddy Holly's band, the Crickets, -- of whom Stu was a huge fan -- he recommended the name of \"The Beetles.\"  John changed the spelling of the name to \"Beatles\" as a pun for \"beat music,\" another name for rock 'n' roll.In 1961, back in Hamburg, Stu quit the band and went back to studying art, so Paul took up the bass guitar.

Epstein succeeded in getting the band a record contract in March 1962.  After hearing a few sample songs, George Martin, the producer, decided he liked the music but was even more enchanted with the boys' witty humor.  Martin signed the band to a one-year record contract but recommended a studio drummer for all recordings.  John, Paul, and George used this as an excuse to fire Best and replace him with Ringo Starr.In September 1962, the Beatles recorded their first single.  On one side of the record was the song \"Love Me Do\" and on the flip side, \"P.S. I Love You.\"  Their first single was a success but it was their second, with the song \"Please Please Me,\" that made them their first number-one hit.  By early 1963, their fame began to soar.  After quickly recording a long album, the Beatles spent much of 1963 touring.Though Beatlemania had overtaken Great Britain, the Beatles still had the challenge of the United States. ",

Their first film, A Hard Day's Night portrayed an average day in the life of the Beatles, most of which was running from chasing girls.  The Beatles followed this with four additional movies: Help!  (1965), Magical Mystery Tour (1967), Yellow Submarine (animated, 1968), and Let It Be (1970).\nBy 1966, the Beatles were growing weary of their popularity.  Plus, John caused an uproar when he was quoted as saying, \"We're more popular than Jesus now.\"  The group, tired and worn out, decided to end their touring and solely record albums.\nAbout this same time, the Beatles began to shift to psychedelic influences.  They started using marijuana and LSD and learning about Eastern thought.  These influences shaped their Sgt.  Pepper album.  In August 1967, the Beatles received the terrible news of the sudden death of their manager, Brian Epstein. ",

The band talked a friend of theirs, Stuart Sutcliff, into buying a bass guitar, and added Pete Best on drums.  They began getting recognition around Liverpool.  That was around that time that Brian Epstein heard them playing and proposed that he assume position of their manager.  The Beatles agreed and Epstein quickly arranged for them to go to Hamburg, Germany to play the local music clubs.  While in Germany the band met Ringo Star, who later officially joined the band, taking over for Pete Best.  When the band was to return to England, Stuart decide that he wanted to stay in Germany with the girl he had met and fallen in love with there.  So Paul picked up the bass guitar, they dropped the Silver from their name, and the Fab Four, as we came to know them, was ready for success.\n  The Beatles were now ready to record their first album.  Epstein introduced the band to the man sometimes referred to as the 5th Beatle, George Martin.  Martin went on to produce all but one of the Beatles albums.  Love me Do was their first record, released in October 1962. ",

Fredric Lewis of a London newspaper examined the sociological implications of Beatle-Mania and said hey are working class and their roots and their attitude are firmly in the north of England.  They are part of a strong-flowing reaction against the soft, middleclass south of England, which has controlled popular culture for so longHe added ecause of their success, they can act as spokesman for the new, noisy, anti-establishment generation which is become a force in British life\nOne can assume then, that people were ready for a change.  The Beatles were one band that could offer change.  With forthcoming albums ,such as evolver ubber Soul\nand gt.  Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band the Beatles proved that change was a very good thing. gt.  Pepperswas considered the first concept album(songs unified by a common theme).  No longer singing just dopey love songs, the Beatles branched out into a new uncharted territory.  This period of the band included drug experimentation and religious exploration.  The Band stopped touring in 1966, which was due to the strain and stress of the touring that they had endured. ",

In 1963 with the release of ith the Beatles the band found success in both the UK and US, with the single wanna hold your hand In February the Band visited the US to play on the Ed Sullivan show.  Many people consider the Ed Sullivan show appearance to be the coming out party for the Beatles especially in America.  For many it was their first glimpse of the fab four.  There was much hype even before the broadcast.  It was a time in America when Elvis had lost his edge, Ricky Valines, and the Big Bopper were killed, also the beloved president, John F. Kennedy was assassinated.  The Beatles promised something new and fresh and had an attitude people liked.  Anthony Corbett, a noted English psychologist praised the Beatles as having provided desperately needed release for the inhibitions that exist in all of us Whatever it was, the Beatles had something the people needed because like so many bands of today their success didn't end there.

With 17 No.1 hits, their musical development was as rapid as it was innovative - from the pure Merseybeat pop of I Wanna Hold Your Hand to psychedelic mantras of Strawberry Fields Forever and Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds.  (Beatles MP3)\nThe Beatles evolved from the Quarrymen, the band John Lennon (born 9 October, 1940) formed at Quarry Bank school in 1956.  (Beatles MP3) Lennon was obsessed with the rock and roll bands of the era - Buddy Holly, Gene Vincent and Elvis Presley.  Paul McCartney, (born 18 June, 1942.  Beatles MP3) who had impressed Lennon with his musical knowledge and already burgeoning songwriting skills joined the band in 1957 and the pair immediately started writing together.  (Beatles MP3)  Within a year, two more musicians had been brought in, the 15-year-old guitarist George Harrison, Beatles MP3 (b. 25 February 1943, Liverpool, England, d. 29 November 2001, Los Angeles, California, USA) and an art school friend of Lennon's, Stuart Sutcliffe (b. 23 June 1940, Edinburgh, Scotland, d. 10 April 1962, Hamburg, Germany).

Moreover, they were among the few artists of any discipline that were simultaneously the best at what they did and the most popular at what they did.\nRelentlessly imaginative and experimental, the Beatles grabbed a hold of the international mass consciousness in 1964 and never let go for the next six years, always staying ahead of the pack in terms of creativity but never losing their ability to communicate their increasingly sophisticated ideas to a mass audience.  Their supremacy as rock icons remains unchallenged to this day, decades after their breakup in 1970.\nEven when couching praise in specific terms, it's hard to convey the scope of The Beatles' achievements in a mere paragraph or two.  They synthesized all that was good about early rock & roll, and changed it into something original and even more exciting.  They established the prototype for the self-contained rock group that wrote and performed its own material.  As composers, their craft and melodic inventiveness were second-to-none, and key to the evolution of rock from its blues/R&B-based forms into a style that was far more eclectic, but equally visceral.

McCartney took over on bass, Harrison settled in as lead guitarist, and Lennon had rhythm guitar; everyone sang.  In mid-1961, the Beatles (minus Sutcliffe) made their first recordings in Germany, as a backup group to a British rock guitarist/singer based in Hamburg, Tony Sheridan.  The Beatles hadn't fully developed at this point, and these recordings - many of which (including a couple of Sheridan-less tracks) were issued only after the band's rise to fame - found their talents in a most embryonic state.  The Hamburg stint was also notable for gaining The Beatles sophisticated, artistic fans such as Sutcliffe's girlfriend, Astrid Kirchherr, who influenced all of them (except Best) to restyle their quiffs in the moptops that gave the musicians their most distinctive visual trademark.  (Sutcliffe, tragically, would die of a brain hemorrhage in April 1962).\nNear the end of 1961, The Beatles' exploding local popularity caught the attention of local record store manager Brian Epstein, who was soon managing the band as well.

                "text": "As singers, both John Lennon and Paul McCartney were among the best and most expressive vocalists in rock; the group's harmonies were intricate and exhilarating. As performers, they were (at least until touring had ground them down) exciting and photogenic; when they retreated into the studio, they were instrumental in pioneering advanced techniques and multi-layered arrangements.  They were also the first British rock group to achieve worldwide prominence, launching a British Invasion that made rock truly an international phenomenon.\nMore than any other top group, The Beatles' success was very much a case of the whole being greater than the sum of its parts.  Their phenomenal cohesion was due in large degree to most of the group having known each other and played together in Liverpool for about five years before they began to have hit records.  Guitarist and teenage rebel John Lennon got hooked on rock & roll in the mid-'50s, and formed a band, the Quarrymen, at his secondary school.  Around mid-1957, the Quarrymen were joined by another guitarist, Paul McCartney, nearly two years Lennon's junior.  A bit later they were joined by another guitarist, George Harrison, a friend of McCartney's. ",

They punched each other on stage.  Spitz says the band's days in Hamburg were exhausting, but crucial to the Beatles' development.  \"Then when they got to Hamburg, they really worked hard, they played 11 hours a night, and they became what we now know as The Beatles.  When it came time for them to get a record deal and Brian Epstein shopped them around, they got the same message from everyone, and that message was that guitar bands are out.\"E.M.I.  executives decided to take a chance on the band with one key condition.  That demand would forever change the course of two lives, including that of a young drummer from another Liverpool band, Ringo Starr.  \"Earlier on, their drummer was someone else, it was Pete Best.  He was really their first drummer.  He had worked with them for two years. ",

Catch them \"LIVE\" before they become older than the originals!\nBiography:\nThe story starts in 1995, when a show was put together to perform in a special production of \"All You Need Is Love\" at the Ecos Amphitheatre, Frome, Somerset.  Such was the success of the show that there emerged a band, an eight piece with a backing group of five musicians and three vocalists as the front men of the band.  This ensemble enjoyed successful gigs round local pubs and clubs performing material from the Pepper album and songs from the psychedelic era.  Audiences were fascinated by this rather unusual Beatles tribute line-up with three vocalists - but the music was good and so was the humour!\n  After a couple of years of playing gigs the eight piece was reduced.  A five piece then emerged with all members being fully involved with the action.  They soon became an in-demand band with a set of Beatles covers that ran from the early rock 'n' roll numbers through to the later more complex songs of the late 60's. ",

With Mea Culpa, Jim performed at venues from the Glenview House to Grant Park during the 1990s.  Jim recently finished a CD of original songs, distributed by his own Mystical label (and on amazon.com), and played in clubs including the resurrected (Biddy) Mulligan's under names such as Collectively Unconscious and the Jim O'Connell All-Star Band.  Paul Trottier - Lead Guitar Began playing guitar at age 11 (Beatles, right?).  On to bands & rock'n tunes in High School with bands Damien, Ambivalence, and others on stage for school dances and parties in the Burlington, VT area.  Continued on to form Bacchanalia, and later, The Frank Band, playing at frat parties and ski lodges.  In those wild days of '79 Paul moved to Chicago and joined\u00a0 The Slammer Band, then Sidekix playing Chicago nightclubs.\u00a0 Influences include Eric Clapton, BB King, Jimmy Page, Jeff Beck, Santana, Jimmy Hendrix, Alvin Lee, Joe Walsh, and others.

The band was made up entirely of classmates at Quarry Bank Grammar School in Liverpool, and almost immediately after they started, they changed their name to The Quarry Men.  They played skiffle music, a mixture of folk, jazz, and blues which was popular in England at the time.\n  In the summer of 1957, The Quarry Men were setting up for a performance in a church hall when another member of the band introduced Lennon to Paul McCartney, then a 15-year-old self-taught left-handed guitar player.  He auditioned for the band when they finished their set, and was immediately invited to join, which he did in October, 1957.\nBy February 1958 Lennon was moving increasingly away from skiffle and toward rock 'n' roll.

In its glory years the group consisted of guitarist and main songwriter Pete Townshend (b. 19 May 1945), singer Roger Daltrey (b. 1 March 1944), bassist John Entwistle (b. 9 October 1944, d. 27 June 2002) and drummer Keith Moon (b. 23 August 1946, d. 7 September 1978).  Early on the group was part of the \"Mod\" movement, playing R&B music in stylized tailored suits, before morphing into an unruly proto-punk band famous for smashing its instruments at the end of live performances.

Daltry was a blonde-maned and bare-chested lead singer, Townshend an energetic dervish on guitar.  Moon became one of rock-and-roll's great flameouts, famous for his savage drumming and whimsically mad offstage life until his sudden death at age 32.  Burly bassist Entwistle anchored the group, standing stoically alongside Townshend's leaps and windmills.  The band continued on after the deaths of Moon and later Entwistle, touring and recording into the 21st century. ",
