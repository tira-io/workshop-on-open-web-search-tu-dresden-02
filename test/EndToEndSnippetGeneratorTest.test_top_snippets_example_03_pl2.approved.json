First, look for a program that is approved by the American Bar Association, or ABA.  And find out what employers in your area require for entry-level paralegals.  \u201cThere are a lot of two-year associate and four-year programs,\u201d says Harbour.  \u201cIn my region, today\u2019s employers are seeking entry-level paralegals with four-year degrees from ABA-approved programs,\u201d she says.  Naiser says that in Texas, the four-year degree always is preferred, but only required in about one-fourth of job postings.  \u201cA paralegal certificate and on-point experience are more important.\u201d\nCertification also gets complicated, so get good advice from your local bar association or paralegal/legal assistant association.  Requirements vary, but after completing education from one of about 1,000 formal education programs in the country at the associate, bachelor\u2019s or certificate level, you might take an examination from an association such as the National Association of Legal Assistants, or NALA.  The ABA does not certify paralegals, only education programs. ",

As the text progresses, students learn how to think critically about their tasks and responsibilities as a group leader; develop clinical judgment; explore their own personal development; learn the stages of group development; and identify practical strategies and constructive uses of group dynamics.  \u00a0 Becoming a Group Leaderintegrates theory and practice so that group leaders learn not only the methods, models and philosophies surrounding successful group counseling but that they also learn how to apply these lessons through specific strategies for planning and facilitating unique types of both clinical and non-clinical groups.  Unlike other texts that might focus on skill development over concept and theory, this book puts forth that understanding the ideas behind group dynamics and counseling is vital in applying them in real-life situations.\nAn integrative theoretical approach to group leadership throughout the text lends students a greater expertise and deeper understanding for leading both clinical and non-clinical groups.

The driving force behind this predicted increase is the attempt to provide more affordable and efficient availability of legal services in the coming years.  Although many students enter the profession through formal paralegal training programs, a degree in criminal justice is an alternative path to joining the rapidly expanding discipline of paralegal studies.\nWhat is a Paralegal?\nParalegal jobs with a criminal justice degree involve many of the same tasks performed by an attorney.  Lawyers delegate tasks, such as researching facts and preparing documents for court, to the paralegal with a criminal justice degree.

Program guidelines are simple and requirements minimal.  Mentors and proteges are matched based on common professional interests and other factors, such as practice preference and geographic region.  Pairs should have at least three contacts during the academic year.  Mentors and proteges may agree to have more contacts.  The first contact may be our exciting October \"Kick-Off\" event.  We hope that mentoring relationships will continue beyond the student's first year.  As a mentor, you can share informal advice on a wide range of topics including law school, legal practice areas, ethical issues, and the role of lawyers and judges in the profession.  The Program provides you with an excellent opportunity to help shape the future of the profession, strengthen the \"Widener Network,\" and make a positive difference in the development of a future colleague.  Many mentors report benefits to themselves as well.  Mentors may find their own appreciation for the legal profession renewed through exposure to the excitement and idealism of a first-year law student.  The only requirements for a mentor are membership in any state's bar and two years of experience.  Participation is voluntary. ",

Become a True Consultant\nby Gloria Blackmon, RNC, BSN, Kansas\nI must start by saying that every person has the right to choose how they want to enter the world of legal nurse consulting.  Looking back on my own nursing career, I wish I'd pursued a BSN initially, rather than an ADN.  This is not because I think I suddenly became a better nurse as a BSN graduate, but because the ADN was not in alignment with my career goals.  In my enthusiasm to get out quickly and start working, I did not look farther down the road, and it took me a long time to earn my BSN while rotating shifts every four weeks. ",

Our target markets (ie.  attorneys and insurance companies) are still confused about what a legal nurse consultant can really do for them.  When you mix paralegal tasks with the role of the consultant nurse, a nurse paralegal becomes more multitask oriented and has less autonomy.  As nurses, we are very talented in performing multiple roles, but I doubt that doing paralegal work is our goal in becoming legal nurse consultants.\nI personally do not want to do any tasks like a nurse paralegal; I want to use my nursing knowledge to assist attorneys and their paralegal staffs with cases.  We have been indoctrinated over the years that we may not be needed solely for our nursing skills.  In venturing onto a new career path, some nurses think having a paralegal background may give them extra insurance in breaking into the field, only to find out they have been taken advantage of and are undervalued as paralegals rather than as true consultants.\nNurses have told me they thought that, by becoming nurse paralegals, they would learn things about the law that were essential to communicating and navigating the legal world.

I took a couple of years off after high school (in my family it was a big deal simply to have graduated high school, there was no expectation to do anything more).

I\u2019d worked for a sole practitioner for those three years and gained invaluable experience.  Then I went to work for a mid-size law firm.  It was a very different experience and my first time working with articling students.  They were paid barely more than I was (I made about $30,000 a year at the time).  They often seemed ill-prepared for the real work of a law firm.  Don\u2019t get me wrong, they were smart and I really enjoyed working with them.  It just made it clear to me that law school didn\u2019t bother with practical matters, teaching a lot about theory and research and not much else.  These are important things, but my opinion is that all schools should combine theory with practical work. ",

Forget about all those white shirts and ties, those empty suits shuffling papers with empty minds.  It's all B.S. - I know, I did corporate work for 12 years before a well planned exodus.

The typical paralegal education is a two-year associate's degree, and four-year degrees also are becoming popular.  Two- and four-year paralegal and legal studies degrees are offered at private and public colleges and universities across South Florida.  People with any bachelor's degree can qualify to sit for a paralegal national certification exam.  The South Florida Paralegal Association offers scholarships to paralegal students attending local schools.Being a paralegal doesn't require a license, but some employers are looking for paralegals with voluntary national certification and an associate's or bachelor's degree, said attorney Brian Mangines, president of Auslin Legal Staffing in Boca Raton.'I speak to a lot of paralegal classes and I tell them, `Just get inside a law firm and make your way up,' ''  Mangines said.  `  `You have to network your way to success.''That's what Toure and Vessels did.  They both got their start as legal secretaries, another high-growth field because lawyers similarly need secretarial assistants to help manage a flood of paperwork and data. ",

If you are able to do deductive reasoning and think logically, you will be successful.''This relatively young, expanding profession is expected to maintain growth over the next decade, due in part to the vast stores of electronic information that need to be investigated and managed in the legal arena.  While most paralegals work for law firms, they are also employed by government agencies, corporate legal departments, banks, insurance companies and real estate firms.You can become a paralegal in several ways: an online course leading to a paralegal certificate can take as little as four months and can cost as little as $1,000.

Lawyers are often assisted in their work by paralegals\nor legal assistants.  Paralegals perform many of the same tasks\nas lawyers, except for those considered to be the practice of\nlaw.  Paralegals work for lawyers.  Although the lawyers assume\nresponsibility for the legal work, they often delegate many of\ntheir tasks to paralegals.  Paralegals are prohibited from setting\nlegal fees, giving legal advice and presenting cases in court.\n  After organizing and analyzing\nthe information, paralegals may prepare written reports that\nattorneys use in determining how cases should be handled.  Should\nattorneys decide to file lawsuits on behalf of clients, paralegals\nmay help prepare the legal arguments, draft pleadings and motions\nto be filed with the court, obtain affidavits, and assist attorneys\nduring trials.  Paralegals also organize and track files of all\ndocuments and correspondence important to cases, and make them\navailable to attorneys.\nParalegals may work in all areas\nof the law, including litigation, bankruptcy, corporate law,\ncriminal law, employee benefits, patent and copyright law, and\nreal estate.  They help draft contracts, mortgages, separation\nagreements and trust instruments. ",

Did you know that in order to become a true cosmetologist you must have a state license?  While qualifications for work do vary from state to state, going to cosmetology school is the best way to ensure you get the job you want.\nTypically, cosmetologists work on improving the appearance of their clients through cosmetics and other beauty services such as skin care products, facials, makeup applying and more.  Some cosmetologists advance to working in theatrical settings, doing stage makeup and performance makeup, and makeup for the camera such as modeling and movies.\nWhile many cosmetologists work for large salons and department stores, many who graduate from cosmetology school create and manage their own individual companies, selling makeup and skin care products and managing their own clientele.

I have a rather varied and experienced past job profile; model, bartender, administrative assistant, photography assistant, film production manager, and currently, a media analyst for top pharmaceutical companies.\nI need a relatively stable and well-paying career, and I am willing to go back to school to \"land the job\".\nI already have a BA in Anthropology.\nI see that to become a paralegal I should obtain a certificate through an ABA-approved program, but to become an accountant...I can either get a 2nd Bachelor's or try for a Master's in Accounting.

Approximately 250 out of 1,200 paralegal programs nationwide are ABA approved - and the majority of ABA-approved programs are offered by smaller community colleges and technical schools.  The ABA approved programs in Georgia are offered by Athens Technical College (Athens), Clayton State University (Morrow), Gainesville State College (Gainesville) and South University (Savannah).\nDoes ABA \"approval\" matter?\nThe ABA does not formally \u201caccredit\u201d any paralegal program, but for a fee, the organization \u201capproves\u201d programs that meet certain standards.  Most paralegal programs choose not to seek ABA \u201capproval\u201d.  ABA \u201capproval\u201d is not a primary factor in most law firms\u2019 decision to hire a paralegal.

In addition, our program is the only paralegal certificate program in Georgia that requires students have a bachelor's degree prior to admission.\nWill graduates be able to sit for the NFPA Pace exam and the NALA CLA exam?\nThe National Association of Legal Assistants (NALA) and the National Federation of Paralegal Associations (NFPA) offer (for a price) voluntary examinations.  No state requires that a paralegal take an exam, and the majority of paralegals have chosen not to take either exam.  NALA offers the CLA Examination, and NFPA offers the PACE Examination.  If a student has a Bachelor's degree in any field and graduates from the Emory University Paralegal Program, that student qualifies to sit for the CLA and/or PACE examinations.

The form of program a student takes usually depends on several factors, including:\nPrior Educational Experience - Students who already possess a college degree are not likely to attend a two or four year paralegal program.\nPrior Life Experience - Many paralegal certificate students have valuable real-world experience, but lack qualifications to be competitive for job opportunities.\nMotivation - Students who take certificate programs must be motivated, since they are expected to gain knowledge and skills in a relatively short period of time.\nCompensation - Graduates of certificate programs are best compensated.\nWhy are certificate program graduates paid more?\nAttorneys are interested in paralegals who can perform specific law related tasks efficiently and accurately.  They want, and are willing to pay for, paralegals who possess skills that make them and their firm more productive.  As a general rule, attorneys don't care about the geometry, psychology, and other general study courses an employee has taken.  They care about whether the employee can maintain a client file, whether an employee can conduct legal research, whether an employee can draft legal documents, and perform other relevant tasks. ",

From hospital-based nursing to home nursing, community nursing and beyond, the career options available to formally trained RNs are vast.\nThere are three main paths to becoming a registered nurse.  The most recommended is the bachelor of science in nursing (BSN), a 4-5 year program covering a wide array of theoretical and technical nursing skills.  BSN programs are a minimum requirement for many RN positions.  Another option is the associate degree in nursing (ADN), which is usually a two-year program covering the technical aspects of nursing.  Less common, but still in use is the diploma, a 3-year program covering basic nursing skills. ",

Registered nurses holding associate degrees and diplomas sometimes pursue further education in the form of an RN-to-BSN program.  In fact, nurses often finish an ADN program to gain entry-level employment, then use their employer's tuition reimbursement benefits to finish their BSN degrees.  Of course, the level of education you choose to pursue will depend on the type of nursing you wish to go into.\nPrerequisite course work\nA typical BSN nursing curriculum consists of two parts: the biological, physical, and social sciences that contributes to the science of nursing, and the liberal arts component that develops the intelligence, social, and cultural aspects of nursing.

However, each student must first complete an entrance exam -- this could be the Nursing Entrance Test (NET), a three-hour test that covers basic math, English and reading skills, or the Test of Essential Academic Skills (TEAS), which gauges the student's abilities in math, English, reading and science.  Information on the NET test can be found at StudyGuideZone.com, and the TEAS test is explained at TestPrepReview.com.

Early communications were in\nthe form of newsletters that were little more than one-page notices of meetings.\nBy June, 1983, the newsletter included a listing of suggested names for the\npublication.  At the July meeting the name he PARAVIEWwas adopted.  By June,\n1987, the PARAVIEW was expanded to a magazine- style format published quarterly\nwith substantive articles, pictures and regular and special feature articles.\nUntil 1999, between quarterly issues of the PARAVIEW, a six page supplemental\nnewsletter, the PARAVIEW EXTRA kept members advised of the Association meeting\ndates and activities.\nMPA established a scholarship to assist students in the\nMetrolina area paralegal technology programs.  The scholarship, known as the\nMeredith R. Pollette Memorial Scholarship (named in memory of a founding member\nand a staunch supporter of MPA), is an essay contest with entries judged by\nselected members of MPA.  Over the years, the amount of the scholarship has\nincreased to its current amount of $300. ",
