The unnamed game will be ready by the 2009 holiday season, and promises to take players on a journey through the Beatles music, sampling songs from all stages of the band's career.\nDetails on the actual game experience was scarce, but Harmonix CEO Alex Rigopoulus says the game will be a standalone product -- not an expansion pack -- but also that it would not be a 'Rock Band' game.  He says that the game will \"be compatible with existing Rock Band peripherals...\"\nJeff Jones, CEO of Apple Corps., says they decided to partner with MTV and Harmonix (instead of Activision, who owns Guitar Hero) because they were \"clearly the innovators\" in music-rhythm games.

Jones says they are working out the details of song downloads on services such as iTunes or Amazon, so that might happen sooner than, well, never.\nRock band 2Rock Band is back and better than ever!

Had he succeeded, we may have been spared many of the indulgent, tedious double albums released in its 30-year wake.  Of course we also would have been cheated out of The Beatles' greatest indulgence, which is anything but tedious.\nEssentially a collection of solo tracks, \"The White Album\" showcases the Fabs at their most absurd (\"Wild Honey Pie,\" \"Piggies\") and their most incendiary (\"Revolution 9,\" \"Why Don't We Do it in the Road?\").  You get Lennon's most rousing rocker in \"Everybody's Got Something to Hide Except For Me and My Monkey,\" and the most tender, emotionally honest moment of his career in the maternal ode \"Julia.\"\nSeemingly bound by no limits of good taste or good sense, Paul tinkers with 12-bar blues on \"Birthday,\" music hall on \"Honey Pie\" and folk/country on \"Rocky Raccoon.\" ",

To use the guitar controller, players must hold the fret button that corresponds to the scrolling colored note on-screen while simultaneously pushing the strum bar.  In addition, five smaller fret buttons are located further down on the neck.  These buttons can be used to play all notes in guitar solos (denoted by the note track turning blue) as hammer-ons and pull-offs, without strumming.[14] A special effects switch can be used to toggle between five different guitar effects during solos and Overdrive periods (none, wah-wah, flange, chorus, and echo for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions; none, doubler, slap back echo, medium echo, and long echo for PlayStation 2, and none, flange, slap back echo, chorus, and echo for the Wii version[17]).  Overdrive for guitarists can be deployed by holding the controller in a vertical position or pressing the \"Select/Back\" button.  The controller is offered in both wired and wireless versions. ",

Overdrive for drummers can be deployed by hitting the crash cymbal (green note for right-handed configuration) that appears directly after a freestyle drum fill.  The second version of the controller, distributed with Rock Band 2, introduced quieter, \"velocity sensitive\" drum pads, a reinforced bass pedal, wireless capabilities, and compatibility with separately-sold cymbals.  ION Audio has also produced a premium drum kit that includes cymbals and can be upgraded with a drum brain to be used as an electronic drum kit.\n  The microphone is a standard USB microphone.  Players can use most other USB microphones, while Xbox 360 users can substitute their console's headset, if they wish.  For the most part, singers are judged on how closely they match the pitch of the song's vocalist. ",

To use the guitar controller, players must hold the fret button that corresponds to the scrolling colored note on-screen while simultaneously pushing the strum bar.  In addition, five smaller fret buttons are located further down on the neck.  These buttons can be used to play all notes in guitar solos (denoted by the note track turning blue) as hammer-ons and pull-offs, without strumming.[14] A special effects switch can be used to toggle between five different guitar effects during solos and Overdrive periods (none, wah-wah, flange, chorus, and echo for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions; none, doubler, slap back echo, medium echo, and long echo for PlayStation 2, and none, flange, slap back echo, chorus, and echo for the Wii version[17]).  Overdrive for guitarists can be deployed by holding the controller in a vertical position or pressing the \"Select/Back\" button.  The controller is offered in both wired and wireless versions. ",

The second version of the controller, distributed with Rock Band 2, introduced quieter, \"velocity sensitive\" drum pads, a reinforced bass pedal, wireless capabilities, and compatibility with separately-sold cymbals.  ION Audio has also produced a premium drum kit that includes cymbals and can be upgraded with a drum brain to be used as an electronic drum kit.\n  The microphone is a standard USB microphone.

Their first film, A Hard Day's Night portrayed an average day in the life of the Beatles, most of which was running from chasing girls.  The Beatles followed this with four additional movies: Help!  (1965), Magical Mystery Tour (1967), Yellow Submarine (animated, 1968), and Let It Be (1970).\nBy 1966, the Beatles were growing weary of their popularity.  Plus, John caused an uproar when he was quoted as saying, \"We're more popular than Jesus now.\"  The group, tired and worn out, decided to end their touring and solely record albums.\nAbout this same time, the Beatles began to shift to psychedelic influences.  They started using marijuana and LSD and learning about Eastern thought.  These influences shaped their Sgt.  Pepper album.  In August 1967, the Beatles received the terrible news of the sudden death of their manager, Brian Epstein. ",

Though John was only 16, he had already formed a band called the Quarry Men, who were performing at the fete.

The Beatles were preceded by a John Lennon fronted band called the Quarry men.  The group invited a 15 year old boy named Paul McCartney to see them perform a show.  The then 16 year old John Lennon took to McCartney, that when a unique and amazing song writing partnership began.  The Quarry Men ended up falling apart at the seams. ",

Perhaps their most popular work.  By that time John had married Yoko Ono, a photographer, and the band was falling apart.  The band would release 2 more albums.  et It Be and bbey Road et It Beinvolved making a film in which they were filmed rehearsing, recording, and finally performing new songs.  Problems during the recording led it to be left aside.  Then they released bbey Roadin 1969 and In April 1970 Paul announced that he was leaving the group.  The others followed.\nWith the Beatles no longer together Producer Phil Spector sorted through hundreds of hours of tapes, and put together what would be the last Beatles album Let It Be in 1970.  Ironically it was a song from this album that gave the Beatles their first Grammy.  The long and winding road won the Grammy for the best song for a motion picture.  Rumors of a reunion were popular until 1980 when John Lennon was murdered.\n  The Beatles obviously affected many lives from the shrieking girls and cheering boys, to the parents of those kids, to the police officers that tried their best to contain the uncontrollable mobs of fans.

In 1963 with the release of ith the Beatles the band found success in both the UK and US, with the single wanna hold your hand In February the Band visited the US to play on the Ed Sullivan show.  Many people consider the Ed Sullivan show appearance to be the coming out party for the Beatles especially in America.  For many it was their first glimpse of the fab four.  There was much hype even before the broadcast.  It was a time in America when Elvis had lost his edge, Ricky Valines, and the Big Bopper were killed, also the beloved president, John F. Kennedy was assassinated.  The Beatles promised something new and fresh and had an attitude people liked.  Anthony Corbett, a noted English psychologist praised the Beatles as having provided desperately needed release for the inhibitions that exist in all of us Whatever it was, the Beatles had something the people needed because like so many bands of today their success didn't end there.

Beatles MP3) who had impressed Lennon with his musical knowledge and already burgeoning songwriting skills joined the band in 1957 and the pair immediately started writing together.  (Beatles MP3)  Within a year, two more musicians had been brought in, the 15-year-old guitarist George Harrison, Beatles MP3 (b. 25 February 1943, Liverpool, England, d. 29 November 2001, Los Angeles, California, USA) and an art school friend of Lennon's, Stuart Sutcliffe (b. 23 June 1940, Edinburgh, Scotland, d. 10 April 1962, Hamburg, Germany).

                "text": "What seems most likely was that The Beatles simply found his personality incompatible, preferring to enlist Ringo Starr (born Richard Starkey), a drummer with another popular Merseyside outfit, Rory Storm & the Hurricanes. Starr had been in The Beatles for a few weeks when they recorded their first single, 'Love Me Do'/'P.S. I Love You,' in September 1962.  Both sides of the 45 were Lennon-McCartney originals, and the songwriting team would be credited with most of the group's material throughout The Beatles' career.\nThe single, a promising but fairly rudimentary effort, hovered around the lower reaches of the British Top 20.  The Beatles phenomenon didn't truly kick in until 'Please Please Me,' which topped the British charts in early 1963.  This was the prototype British Invasion single: an infectious melody, charging guitars, and positively exuberant harmonies.  The same traits were evident on their third 45, 'From Me to You' (a British number one), and their debut LP, 'Please Please Me'. ",

After weeks of deliberation, Decca turned them down as did several other British labels.  Epstein's perseverance was finally rewarded with an audition for producer George Martin at Parlophone, an EMI subsidiary; Martin signed The Beatles in mid-1962.  By this time, Epstein was assiduously grooming his charges for national success by influencing them to smarten up their appearance, dispensing with their leather jackets and trousers in favor of tailored suits and ties.\n  One more major change was in the offing before The Beatles made their Parlophone debut.  In August 1962, drummer Pete Best was kicked out of the group, a controversial decision that has been the cause of much speculation since.  There is still no solid consensus as to whether it was because of his solitary, moody nature; the other Beatles' jealousy of his popularity with the fans; his musical shortcomings (George Martin had already told Epstein that Best wasn't good enough to drum on recordings); or his refusal to wear his hair down.

He had come in a sport coat that had silver and gold threads woven into it, and it was a 15-year-old kid who bicycled over from the next community and his name was Paul McCartney.  He had been brought by one of John's friends from school because the friend thought that John and he might get along.  They were introduced after John had played the opening set.\"After  a brief introduction, McCartney asked a fateful question.  \"And Paul brought this guitar on his bicycle into this church festival and asked John if he could play him something.  And John was knocked out.  It was an amazing performance and he knew right away that there was a place in his band for this fat kid named Paul McCartney\"But success was still years in the making for the group, as they toiled in small clubs from Liverpool to Hamburg, Germany.  But the Beatles hard work would eventually pay off.  Still, many record companies rejected them before The Beatles were signed by the British label E.M.I.\nBob Spitz, The Beatles: The Biography (2006)\n\"The Beatles were rejected by everybody. ",

The following year, the Beatles went on to conquer America and the world.  They last recorded as a band in 1969, so why do the Beatles remain so popular to this day?  \"The music is very special,\" says the author.  \"It speaks to everybody of all ages and all generations.  It's terrific music.  It's music that that you don't get tired of hearing 10, 20, 30 years later.\"\"And, of course, it's their voices.  There is so much personality in their voices that it speaks to everybody.  There's something pure, something simple, something so insanely identifiable that everybody connects with it right away and that's one of the miracles of the Beatles.  It's something that they do for all of us in that sound, that it's lasting and enduring.\"Other ",
