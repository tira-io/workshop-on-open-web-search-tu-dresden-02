They occur in service clubs, community organizations or the media.  More often than not, though, they center on how to use the power of government to improve conditions or to solve problems, with a firm conviction that government can solve all problems and that it can do no harm.\nLibertarians take issue with the involuntary means government uses to attain its ends.  Mandates and prohibitions invariably limit the allowable range of experimentation.  Freedom allows spontaneous order, which is seen in systems as diverse as artificial neural networks, agoric computers, biological evolution, ecosystems, and free-market economies. ",

The venerable destination, with the brand campaign and slogan, \"It's Time for the Pocono Mountains,\" also provides the ideal backdrop for corporate outings and meetings.  If it's an overnight stay, a weekend getaway or an extended vacation, people are increasingly discovering the convenience and proximity of the Pocono Mountains properties and value-laden packages.\n  In addition to the many golf options, the mountain destination is blessed with numerous lakes and rivers, miles of marked and unmarked trails for hiking and biking, fine dining, shopping and historical site seeing.

During prohibition, the resorts were Puritan in spirit, calling themselves, \"Friendly Mountain Resorts\"; card-playing and gambling were prohibited and golf, tennis, and other sports were not allowed on Sundays.  Before and after World War II, GIs took their wives and families.  The Poconos was then dubbed the \"Honeymoon Capital of the World\".  The heart-shaped tub was popularized here in 1963.  To this day, resorts set the mood right for honeymooners and vacationing couples.  By the 1950s, skiing took hold.  The first snow maker (used by blowing water through a nozzle) was patented in the Poconos and then perfected by 1956.  Interstates were constructed, which made the region more accessible.  Eventually, a speedway was put in, bringing in at least 100,000 NASCAR fans from all over the country twice a year.  As the Poconos has entered the 21st century, more resorts, restaurants, ski areas, and golf courses have arisen; property value has also arisen.  Population of the entire region is upwards of 300,000 residents.\n\u00a0\n ",

They were the Delaware, Iroquois, Shawnee, Minisink, Lenape, and Paupack.  The Dutch arrived in 1659, but were forced out by the English in 1664.  More English and the Germans came in and around 1742.  Modern history begins with the first boarding house hotel, built in 1829 by Anthony Dutot.  It became the center of the resort industry in the mid-1800s.  At the turn of the century, vacationers from Philadelphia and New York City began to flock to the Poconos.  Advertised as \"Pennsylvania's Playground\", the communities began a century's long serious development.  Lake Wallenpaupack was created by damming the creek and building a hydro-electric plant. ",

They occur in service clubs, community organizations or the media.  More often than not, though, they center on how to use the power of government to improve conditions or to solve problems, with a firm conviction that government can solve all problems and that it can do no harm.\nLibertarians take issue with the involuntary means government uses to attain its ends.  Mandates and prohibitions invariably limit the allowable range of experimentation.  Freedom allows spontaneous order, which is seen in systems as diverse as artificial neural networks, agoric computers, biological evolution, ecosystems, and free-market economies. ",

We were sorry to see that the Brookdale on the Lake resort was sold.  Even though we will still go every year.\nSome guests have complained about the service being a little slow in the dining room.  It can be, but we did not care because we wanted to take our time and relax.

I\ndo feel it effected our head to head matchups.  Still crushing the man this year\nagain in Nascar!\nFor starters, I think Denny Hamlin has the best shot of winning this race.\nHamlin has 2 wins, 4 Top 5 finishes and 5 Top 10 finishes in his 5 starts here\nin Pocono.  Hamlin an average finish of 2.8 here in Pocono which is the best\naverage finish among all drivers.  Past 2 years, Denny Hamlin's average finish at\ntrack type - FLAT SUPERSPEEDWAY is 7.4.  In 5 races, he has 0 wins and 4 top 10\nfinishes.\nNext in line I would go with Jeff Gordon.  Gordon has four wins, 15 Top 5\nfinishes and 21 Top 10 finishes in 31 starts here in Pocono.  Gordon has an\naverage finish of 10.3 here in Pocono.  Past two seasons, Jeff Gordon's average\nfinish at track type - FLAT SUPERSPEEDWAY is 5.4.  In 5 races, he has 1 win and 4\ntop 10 finishes. ",
