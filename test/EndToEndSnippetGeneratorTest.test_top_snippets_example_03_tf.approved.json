Harbour is president-elect of the association, which consists of programs approved by or in compliance with ABA guidelines.

In good economic times, paralegals can find more work in corporate, real estate and intellectual property law.  But in difficult economic times, areas such as bankruptcy law may be booming.\n  The field is expected to grow at least 20 percent between now and 2016.  People and companies will continue to need legal services and paralegals help save money in many law firms by easing the burden of the attorney, freeing him or her to spend more time on clients and litigation.\nPay and Benefits\nThe pay for paralegals varies depending on geographic region, employer and level of education or experience.  The U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s latest data put median full-time salaries at about $43,000 a year.  You probably can earn more if you work in the federal government or move into company management.  Naiser says that Texas salaries for entry-level paralegals average about $35,000 - $40,000 per year.\nMost paralegals receive benefits such as sick and vacation leave.  Many also receive pension plans and health insurance coverage, depending on the size and type of employer. ",

First, look for a program that is approved by the American Bar Association, or ABA.  And find out what employers in your area require for entry-level paralegals.  \u201cThere are a lot of two-year associate and four-year programs,\u201d says Harbour.  \u201cIn my region, today\u2019s employers are seeking entry-level paralegals with four-year degrees from ABA-approved programs,\u201d she says.  Naiser says that in Texas, the four-year degree always is preferred, but only required in about one-fourth of job postings.  \u201cA paralegal certificate and on-point experience are more important.\u201d\nCertification also gets complicated, so get good advice from your local bar association or paralegal/legal assistant association.  Requirements vary, but after completing education from one of about 1,000 formal education programs in the country at the associate, bachelor\u2019s or certificate level, you might take an examination from an association such as the National Association of Legal Assistants, or NALA.  The ABA does not certify paralegals, only education programs. ",

Typical programs, such as the criminal justice degree online offered at Warren National University, offer education in both administrative and hands-on aspects of the field.

Program guidelines are simple and requirements minimal.  Mentors and proteges are matched based on common professional interests and other factors, such as practice preference and geographic region.  Pairs should have at least three contacts during the academic year.  Mentors and proteges may agree to have more contacts.  The first contact may be our exciting October \"Kick-Off\" event.  We hope that mentoring relationships will continue beyond the student's first year.  As a mentor, you can share informal advice on a wide range of topics including law school, legal practice areas, ethical issues, and the role of lawyers and judges in the profession.  The Program provides you with an excellent opportunity to help shape the future of the profession, strengthen the \"Widener Network,\" and make a positive difference in the development of a future colleague.  Many mentors report benefits to themselves as well.  Mentors may find their own appreciation for the legal profession renewed through exposure to the excitement and idealism of a first-year law student.  The only requirements for a mentor are membership in any state's bar and two years of experience.  Participation is voluntary. ",

Our target markets (ie.  attorneys and insurance companies) are still confused about what a legal nurse consultant can really do for them.  When you mix paralegal tasks with the role of the consultant nurse, a nurse paralegal becomes more multitask oriented and has less autonomy.  As nurses, we are very talented in performing multiple roles, but I doubt that doing paralegal work is our goal in becoming legal nurse consultants.\nI personally do not want to do any tasks like a nurse paralegal; I want to use my nursing knowledge to assist attorneys and their paralegal staffs with cases.  We have been indoctrinated over the years that we may not be needed solely for our nursing skills.

So I was very excited when I was interviewed for an article in Legal Assistant Today about the rising trend to being a freelance or virtual paralegal and I just wanted to share, hopefully there will be a link available at Legal Assistant Today at some point in the future, but for now you can read the text of the article by Tammy R. Pettinato here!\nOf course, since the article came out I\u2019ve already had a couple of contacts from people who want to become a virtual legal assistant or virtual paralegal.  I know there are a ton of people out there, just like I once was, who love what they do but want more flexibility in their scheduling, or who want to get away from the cubicle world and work with their trusty laptops in a coffee-shop, a tropical paradise or (like me!) just want to work in their comfy home offices.

One needs at least a two-year degree and a paralegal certificate to be competitive.  Entry-level jobs are hard to come by.  It's the old Catch-22 - you need experience to get the job and to get the job you need experience.  Colleges and paralegal school graduate plenty of entry-level paralegals, so there's plenty of competition for very few jobs (There are plenty of experienced paralegals competing for very few jobs, also.).  It's tough, but, take it from someone who knows, not impossible.\nAs was posted above, along with working in law offices, title companies, courts and government, paralegals work in corporations, companies, insurance companies, etc. Again, take it from someone who knows, sometimes it's better NOT to work in a law office.  Law firm attorneys can be very difficult to work for.\nGood luck with whatever you decide to do.\nWas this comment helpful? ",

The typical paralegal education is a two-year associate's degree, and four-year degrees also are becoming popular.  Two- and four-year paralegal and legal studies degrees are offered at private and public colleges and universities across South Florida.  People with any bachelor's degree can qualify to sit for a paralegal national certification exam.  The South Florida Paralegal Association offers scholarships to paralegal students attending local schools.Being a paralegal doesn't require a license, but some employers are looking for paralegals with voluntary national certification and an associate's or bachelor's degree, said attorney Brian Mangines, president of Auslin Legal Staffing in Boca Raton.'I speak to a lot of paralegal classes and I tell them, `Just get inside a law firm and make your way up,' ''  Mangines said.  `  `You have to network your way to success.''That's what Toure and Vessels did.  They both got their start as legal secretaries, another high-growth field because lawyers similarly need secretarial assistants to help manage a flood of paperwork and data. ",

If you are able to do deductive reasoning and think logically, you will be successful.''This relatively young, expanding profession is expected to maintain growth over the next decade, due in part to the vast stores of electronic information that need to be investigated and managed in the legal arena.  While most paralegals work for law firms, they are also employed by government agencies, corporate legal departments, banks, insurance companies and real estate firms.You can become a paralegal in several ways: an online course leading to a paralegal certificate can take as little as four months and can cost as little as $1,000.

The typical paralegal education is a two-year associate's degree, and four-year degrees also are becoming popular.  Two- and four-year paralegal and legal studies degrees are offered at private and public colleges and universities across South Florida.  People with any bachelor's degree can qualify to sit for a paralegal national certification exam.  The South Florida Paralegal Association offers scholarships to paralegal students attending local schools.Being a paralegal doesn't require a license, but some employers are looking for paralegals with voluntary national certification and an associate's or bachelor's degree, said attorney Brian Mangines, president of Auslin Legal Staffing in Boca Raton.'I speak to a lot of paralegal classes and I tell them, `Just get inside a law firm and make your way up,' ''  Mangines said.  `  `You have to network your way to success.''That's what Toure and Vessels did.

Approximately 250 out of 1,200 paralegal programs nationwide are ABA approved - and the majority of ABA-approved programs are offered by smaller community colleges and technical schools.  The ABA approved programs in Georgia are offered by Athens Technical College (Athens), Clayton State University (Morrow), Gainesville State College (Gainesville) and South University (Savannah).\nDoes ABA \"approval\" matter?\nThe ABA does not formally \u201caccredit\u201d any paralegal program, but for a fee, the organization \u201capproves\u201d programs that meet certain standards.  Most paralegal programs choose not to seek ABA \u201capproval\u201d.  ABA \u201capproval\u201d is not a primary factor in most law firms\u2019 decision to hire a paralegal.  The reputation of the institution attended by the paralegal is often much more important. ",

In addition, our program is the only paralegal certificate program in Georgia that requires students have a bachelor's degree prior to admission.\nWill graduates be able to sit for the NFPA Pace exam and the NALA CLA exam?\nThe National Association of Legal Assistants (NALA) and the National Federation of Paralegal Associations (NFPA) offer (for a price) voluntary examinations.  No state requires that a paralegal take an exam, and the majority of paralegals have chosen not to take either exam.  NALA offers the CLA Examination, and NFPA offers the PACE Examination.  If a student has a Bachelor's degree in any field and graduates from the Emory University Paralegal Program, that student qualifies to sit for the CLA and/or PACE examinations.  Please note that the above organizations frequently alter their exams' requirements.

From hospital-based nursing to home nursing, community nursing and beyond, the career options available to formally trained RNs are vast.\nThere are three main paths to becoming a registered nurse.  The most recommended is the bachelor of science in nursing (BSN), a 4-5 year program covering a wide array of theoretical and technical nursing skills.  BSN programs are a minimum requirement for many RN positions.  Another option is the associate degree in nursing (ADN), which is usually a two-year program covering the technical aspects of nursing.  Less common, but still in use is the diploma, a 3-year program covering basic nursing skills. ",

Registered nurses holding associate degrees and diplomas sometimes pursue further education in the form of an RN-to-BSN program.  In fact, nurses often finish an ADN program to gain entry-level employment, then use their employer's tuition reimbursement benefits to finish their BSN degrees.  Of course, the level of education you choose to pursue will depend on the type of nursing you wish to go into.\nPrerequisite course work\nA typical BSN nursing curriculum consists of two parts: the biological, physical, and social sciences that contributes to the science of nursing, and the liberal arts component that develops the intelligence, social, and cultural aspects of nursing.

However, each student must first complete an entrance exam -- this could be the Nursing Entrance Test (NET), a three-hour test that covers basic math, English and reading skills, or the Test of Essential Academic Skills (TEAS), which gauges the student's abilities in math, English, reading and science.  Information on the NET test can be found at StudyGuideZone.com, and the TEAS test is explained at TestPrepReview.com.  Schools use students' performance on these tests to determine their eligibility for nursing school.\nNursing school programs\nOnce students enter the nursing program, the curriculum becomes heavier and more intense.

The Bylaws and Standing Rules have been\namended several times over the years.\nMeetings have been held at various places in the greater\nCharlotte area and are presently held at St. Peter Episcopal Church.\n  One of MPA primary purposes is to foster continuing\neducation.  This was easily put into place as far as the monthly meetings were\nconcerned.  The original policy established was to conduct at least six\neducational meetings per year.  The more ambitious goal of continuing legal\neducation in the form of a full day annual seminar was implemented. ",
